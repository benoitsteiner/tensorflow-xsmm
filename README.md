**TensorFlow** is an open source software library for numerical computation using
data flow graphs.  The graph nodes represent mathematical operations, while
the graph edges represent the multidimensional data arrays (tensors) that flow
between them.  This flexible architecture enables you to deploy computation to one
or more CPUs or GPUs in a desktop, server, or mobile device without rewriting
code.  TensorFlow also includes [TensorBoard](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/summaries_and_tensorboard), a data visualization toolkit.

TensorFlow was originally developed by researchers and engineers
working on the Google Brain team within Google's Machine Intelligence Research
organization for the purposes of conducting machine learning and deep neural
networks research.  The system is general enough to be applicable in a wide
variety of other domains, as well.

## Installation
*See [Installing TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/get_started/os_setup.html) for instructions on how to install our release binaries or how to build from source.*

People who are a little more adventurous can also try our nightly binaries:

**Nightly pip packages**
* We are pleased to announce that TensorFlow now offers nightly pip packages
under the [tf-nightly](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/tf-nightly) and
[tf-nightly-gpu](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/tf-nightly-gpu) project on pypi.
Simply run `pip install tf-nightly` or `pip install tf-nightly-gpu` in a clean
environment to install the nightly TensorFlow build. We support CPU and GPU
packages on Linux, Mac, and Windows.


#### *Try your first TensorFlow program*
```shell
$ python
```
```python
>>> import tensorflow as tf
>>> hello = tf.constant('Hello, TensorFlow!')
>>> sess = tf.Session()
>>> sess.run(hello)
'Hello, TensorFlow!'
>>> a = tf.constant(10)
>>> b = tf.constant(32)
>>> sess.run(a + b)
42
>>> sess.close()
```
