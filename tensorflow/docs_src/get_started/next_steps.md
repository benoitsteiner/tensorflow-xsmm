# Next Steps

## Learn more about TensorFlow

* The [TensorFlow Guide](/guide) includes usage guides for the
  high-level APIs, as well as advanced TensorFlow operations.
* [Premade Estimators](/guide/premade_estimators) are designed to
  get results out of the box. Use TensorFlow without building your own models.
* [TensorFlow.js](https://js.tensorflow.org/) allows web developers to train and
  deploy ML models in the browser and using Node.js.
* [TFLite](/mobile/tflite) allows mobile developers to do inference efficiently
  on mobile devices.
* [TensorFlow Serving](/serving) is an open-source project that can put
  TensorFlow models in production quickly.
* The [ecosystem](/ecosystem) contains more projects, including
  [Magenta](https://magenta.tensorflow.org/), [TFX](/tfx),
  [Swift for TensorFlow](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift), and more.
