# Terminology:
#
#  - op: a possibly composite operation, which has an entry in the tape
#  - target: dy in dx/dy
#  - source: dx in dx/dy
#  - tensor: one of the many inputs or outputs of an operation
#
# Below here we do the gradient algorithm. It works as follows:
#
# First we filter the tape to just the subset of operations we want to
# differentiate. In the process of doing so we count how many times each Tensor
# is used as an input to an op (so we know when we're done computing gradients
# for that Tensor). We also count, for each tape entry, how many of its output
# Tensors need gradients to be computed (Tensors which are not used do not need
# any gradients to be computed).
#
# Finally, we start a backprop stack with a set of tape entries for which we
# have all gradients available. This set usually is a subset of the set of
# targets (not all since targets which have outputs in the tape will not have
# gradients available initially).
#
# Then we repeatedly pop an entry from the stack, run its backprop, and update
# the gradients of its inputs. Once we have computed all gradients for a single
# input we can mark this input as done, and this can trigger adding an entry to
# the stack if all outputs of that entry are now done.
#
# When the stack is empty we have gradients for all tensors we're interested in.
