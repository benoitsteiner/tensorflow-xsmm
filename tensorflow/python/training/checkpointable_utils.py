  a class, dependency names (the names of attributes to which `Checkpointable`

  contrast to the `Variable.name`-based save/restore from `tf.train.Saver`, and

    Restores `root_checkpointable` and any objects that it tracks

    been created already, or defers restoration until the variables are
    created. Dependencies added to the `root_checkpointable` passed to the
    constructor after this call will be matched if they have a corresponding
    object in the checkpoint.

    When building a graph, restorations are added to the graph but not run.

    To disallow deferred loading, assert immediately that all checkpointed
    variables have been matched to variable objects:

    ```python
    saver = Saver(root)
    saver.restore(path).assert_consumed()
    ```

    An exception will be raised unless every object was matched and its
    variables already exist.

    When graph building, `assert_consumed()` indicates that all of the restore
    ops which will be created for this checkpoint have been created. They can be
    run via the `run_restore_ops()` function of the status object:

    ```python
    saver.restore(path).assert_consumed().run_restore_ops()
    ```

    If the checkpoint has not been consumed completely, then the list of restore
    ops will grow as more objects are added to the dependency graph.

    Name-based `tf.train.Saver` checkpoints can be loaded using this
    method. There is no deferred loading, and names are used to match
    variables. No restore ops are created/run until `run_restore_ops()` or
    `initialize_or_restore()` are called on the returned status object, even
    when executing eagerly. Re-encode name-based checkpoints using this
    object-based `Saver.save` as soon as possible.

    Args:
      save_path: The path to the checkpoint, as returned by `save` or
        `tf.train.latest_checkpoint`. If None (as when there is no latest
        checkpoint for `tf.train.latest_checkpoint` to return), returns an

      `save_path` is `None`).
