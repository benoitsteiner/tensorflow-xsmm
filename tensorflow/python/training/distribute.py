# Base classes for all distribution strategies.


class DistributionStrategy(object):
  """A list of devices with a state & compute distribution policy.

  The intent is that you can write an algorithm in a stylized way and
  it will be usable with a variety of different `DistributionStrategy`
  implementations. Each descendant will implement a different strategy
  for distributing the algorithm across multiple devices/machines.
  Furthermore, these changes can be hidden inside the specific layers
  and other library classes that need special treatment to run in a
  distributed setting, so that most users' model definition code can
  run unchanged. The `DistributionStrategy` API works the same way
  with eager and graph execution.

  First let's introduce a few high-level concepts:

  * _Data parallelism_ is where we run multiple copies of the model
    on different slices of the input data. This is in contrast to
    _model parallelism_ where we divide up a single copy of a model
    across multiple devices.
    Note: for now we only support data parallelism at this time, but
    hope to add support for model parallelism in the future.
  * A _tower_ is one copy of the model, running on one slice of the
    input data.
  * _Synchronous_, or more commonly _sync_, training is when the
    updates from each tower are aggregated together before updating
    the model variables. This is in contrast to _asynchronous_, or
    _async_ training where each tower updates the model variables
    independently.
  * Furthermore you might run your computation on multiple devices
    on one machine (or "host"), or on multiple machines/hosts.
    If you are running on multiple machines, you might have a
    single master host that drives computation across all of them,
    or you might have multiple clients driving the computation
    asynchronously.

  To distribute an algorithm, we might use some of these ingredients:

  * Parameter servers: These are hosts that hold a single copy of
    parameters/variables. All towers that want to operate on a variable
    retrieve it at the beginning of a step and send an update to be
    applied at the end of the step. Can support either sync or async
    training.
  * Mirrored variables: These are variables that are copied to multiple
    devices, where we keep the copies in sync by applying the same
    updates to every copy. Normally would only be used with sync training.
  * Reductions and Allreduce: A _reduction_ is some method of
    aggregating multiple values into one value, like "sum" or
    "mean". If doing sync training, we will perform a reduction on the
    gradients to a parameter from each tower before applying the
    update. Allreduce is an algorithm for performing a reduction on
    values from multiple devices and making the result available on
    all of those devices.
  * TODO(josh11b): Future: partitioned variables

  We have then a few approaches we want to support:
  * Code written (as if) with no knowledge of class `DistributionStrategy`.
    This code should work as before, even if some of the layers, etc.
    used by that code are written to be distribution-aware. This is done
    by having a default `DistributionStrategy` that gives ordinary behavior,
    and by default being in a single tower context.
  * Ordinary model code that you want to run using a specific
    `DistributionStrategy`. This can be as simple as:

    ```
    with my_distribution.scope():
      iterator = my_distribution.distribute_dataset(dataset)
      # TODO(josh11b): iterator = dataset.make_one_shot_iterator()
      tower_train_ops = my_distribution.call_for_each_tower(
          tower_fn, iterator.get_next())
      train_op = tf.group(my_distribution.unwrap(tower_train_ops))
    ```

    This takes an ordinary `dataset` and `tower_fn` and runs it
    distributed using a particular `DistributionStrategy` in
    `my_distribution`. Any variables created in `tower_fn` are created
    using `my_distribution`'s policy, and library functions called by
    `tower_fn` can use the `get_tower_context()` API to get enhanced
    behavior in this case.
  * If you want to write a distributed algorithm, you may use any of
    the `DistributionStrategy` APIs inside a
    `with my_distribution.scope():` block of code.

  Lower-level concepts:

  * Wrapped values: In order to represent values parallel across devices
    (either towers or the devices associated with a particular value), we
    wrap them in a "PerDevice" or "Mirrored" object that contains a map
    from device to values. "PerDevice" is used when the value may be
    different across devices, and "Mirrored" when the value are the same.
  * Unwrapping and merging: Consider calling a function `fn` on
    multiple devices, like `call_for_each_tower(fn, w)` with an
    argument `w` that is a wrapped value. This means `w` will have a
    map taking tower device `d0` to `w0`, tower device `d1` to `w1`,
    etc. `call_for_each_tower()` unwraps `w` before calling `fn`, so
    it calls `fn(w0)` on `d0`, `fn(w1)` on `d1`, etc.  It then merges
    the return values from `fn()`, which can possibly result in
    wrapped values. For example, let's say `fn()` returns a tuple with
    three components: `(x, a, v0)` from tower 0, `(x, b, v1)` on tower 1,
    etc. If the first component is the same object `x` from every
    tower, then the first component of the merged result will also be
    `x`. If the second component is different (`a`, `b`, ...)  from
    each tower, then the merged value will have a wrapped map from
    tower device to the different values. If the third component is
    the members of a mirrored variable (`v` maps `d0` to `v0`, `d1` to
    `v1`, etc.), then the merged result will be that mirrored variable
    (`v`).
  * Tower context vs. Cross-tower context: _tower context_ is when we
    are in some function that is being called once for each tower.
    Otherwise we are in cross-tower context, which is useful for
    calling `DistributionStrategy` methods which operate across the
    towers (like `reduce()`). By default you start in a tower context
    (the default "single tower context") and then some methods can
    switch you back and forth, as described below.
  * Worker devices vs. parameter devices: Most tower computations will
    happen on worker devices. Since we don't yet support model
    parallelism, there will be one worker device per tower. When using
    parameter servers (see above), the set of devices holding
    variables may be different, otherwise the parameter devices might
    match the worker devices.
  * Non-slot devices are some subset of the parameter devices where we
    put all the non-slot variables. We need to ensure that all
    non-slot variables are allocated on the same device, or mirrored
    across the same set of devices. If you have some variable you want
    to colocate all the non-slot variables with, you can use
    `colocate_vars_with()` to get the remaining non-slot variables on
    the same device.  Otherwise you can use `non_slot_devices()` to
    pick a consistent set of devices to pass to both
    `colocate_vars_with()` and `update_non_slot()`.

  When using a `DistributionStrategy`, we have a new type dimension
  called _locality_ that says what values are compatible with which
  APIs:

  * T: different value for each tower (e.g. a PerDevice-wrapped value).
  * M: value is "mirrored" across towers, i.e. there are copies with the
    same value on each tower (e.g. a Mirrored-wrapped value).
  * V(`v`): value is "mirrored" across all the devices which have a
    copy of variable `v` (also a Mirrored-wrapped value, but over
    parameter devices instead of worker devices).
  * N: value is "mirrored" across all the "non-slot" devices

  Rules for methods with respect to locality and single-tower vs.
  cross-tower context:

  * `with d.scope()`: default single-tower context -> cross-tower context for
    `d`
  * `with d.colocate_vars_with(v)`: in tower/cross-tower context, variables
    will be created with locality V(`v`). That is, if we write
    `with d.colocate_vars_with(v1): v2 = tf.get_variable(...)`, then
    `v2` will have locality V(`v1`), i.e. locality V(`v2`) will equal
    V(`v1`).
  * `with d.colocate_vars_with(d.non_slot_devices(...))`: in
    tower/cross-tower context, variables will be created with locality N
  * `v = tf.get_variable(...)`: in tower/cross-tower context, creates
    a variable (which by definition will have locality V(`v`), though
    will match another locality if inside a `colocate_vars_with`
    scope).
  * `d.distribute_dataset(dataset)`: in cross-tower context, produces an
    iterator with locality T
  * `d.broadcast(t)`: in cross-tower context, produces a value with locality M
  * `d.broadcast(t, v)`: in cross-tower context, produces a value with
    locality V(`v`)
  * `d.call_for_each_tower(fn, ...)`: in cross-tower context, runs
    `fn()` in a tower context (and so may call `get_tower_context()` and
    use its API, including `merge_call()` to get back to cross-tower
    context), once for each tower. May use values with locality T or
    M, and any variable.
  * `d.reduce(m, t)`: in cross-tower context, accepts t with locality T
    and produces a value with locality M.
  * `d.reduce(m, t, v)`: in cross-tower context, accepts t with
    locality T and produces a value with locality V(`v`).
  * `d.batch_reduce(m, [(t, v)]): see `d.reduce()`
  * `d.update(v, fn, ...)`: in cross-tower context, runs `fn()` once
    for each device `v` is copied to, all inputs should have locality
    V(`v`), output will have locality V(`v`) as well.
  * `d.update_non_slot(d.non_slot_devices(), fn)`: in cross-tower
    context, like `d.update()` except with locality N.
  * `d.fetch(t)`: Copy `t` with any locality to the client's CPU device.

  The standard pattern for updating variables is to:

  1. Wrap your input dataset in `d.distribute_dataset()`.
  2. Define each tower `d.call_for_each_tower()` up to the point of
     getting a list of gradient, variable pairs.
  3. Call `d.reduce("sum", t, v)` or `d.batch_reduce()` to sum the
     gradients (with locality T) into values with locality V(`v`).
  4. Call `d.update(v)` for each variable to update its value.

  Steps 3 and 4 are done automatically by class `Optimizer` if you call
  its `apply_gradients` method in a tower context. Otherwise you can
  manually call its `distributed_apply` method in a cross-tower context.

  Another thing you might want to do in the middle of your tower function
  is an all-reduce of some intermediate value, using `d.reduce()` or
  `d.batch_reduce()` without supplying a variable as the destination.

  Layers should expect to be called in a tower context, and can use
  the `get_tower_context()` function to get a `TowerContext` object.  The
  `TowerContext` object has a `merge_call()` method for entering
  cross-tower context where you can use `reduce()` (or
  `batch_reduce()`) and then optionally `update()` to update state.

  You may use this API whether or not a `DistributionStrategy` is
  being used, since there is a default implementation of
  `TowerContext` and `DistributionStrategy`. Or you can use the
  `get_tower_context().is_single_tower` property to run different code
  in the distributed vs. single tower cases.

#   variables). This is intended as an outer scope that users enter once
#   around their model creation and graph definition. There is no
